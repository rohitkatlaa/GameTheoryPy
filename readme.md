# GameTheoryPy - Code for Simulating Games
 This is a python code that helps you find the Nash equilibrium given the payoff function for the players. it can also simulate the working of an iterative game where the beliefs of the players can be updated as the game progresses. It also simulates Iterative Games with custom strategy and also simulate Evolutionary games to find out Evolutionarily Stable Strategy i.e if a strategy is stable across generations and changes in demographics.


 ## Executing the code
 There are examples in the main.py that can be used as a reference for writing further code.

 Run: 
 ```
 python main.py
 ```
